******************************Objects and its internal representation in Javascript*********************************



In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

Creating Objects in JavaScript:
By object literal
By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)



By object literal:
The syntax of creating object using object literal is given below:

Object={property1:value1, property2:value2.............propertyN:valueN}

Property and value is separated by colon(:).

Example:


                                        var person={
                                            fname:'suraj'
                                            lname:'Parkash'
                                            age:25
                                                   };



By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword):
The syntax of creating object directly is given below:


                                    var objectname=new object();




Here, new keyword is used to create object.

Example:

                               var emp=new Object();
                               emp.id=121;
                               emp.name=suraj
                               emp.salary=100000;

Accessing JavaScript Objects:


The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:

objectName.property

or

objectName[“property”]

Accessing ‘fname’ from example 1 using dot operator,

        
                       person.fname


Accessing ‘name’ form example 2 using [],



                        emp["name"]
