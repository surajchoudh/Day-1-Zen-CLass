*******************************IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address****************************

MAC address:

is a unique hardware identifier that recognizes devices on a local scale;
is hardcoded into the device during manufacturing;
is sometimes called a physical address;
can be used by a device for sending data to all devices on the same network through the broadcast MAC address;
resides at Layer 2 of the OSI or TCP/IP reference model; and
is permanent and unchangeable.


IP address:

helps identify a network connection;
is assigned by the network administrator or internet service provider;
describes how the devices on the internet communicate on a global scale;
can be used for broadcasting or multicasting;
resides at Layer 3, or the network layer, of the TCP/IP or OSI model;
can be changed at any time;
is sometimes referred to as the logical address; and
is assigned to devices through software configurations.

HTTP methods:

HTTP request methods
HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: e.g. a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.

GET
The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.

HEAD
The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.

POST
The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

PUT
The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

DELETE
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

CONNECT
The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.

OPTIONS
The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.

TRACE
The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.

PATCH
The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.
